I personally did not use any AI tools to assist me with testing, except for general
debugging of the code, but I can see where it can be used. I don't think that 
generative AI tools would be too helpful for unit testing because there is a chance that
it incorrectly guesses the "actual value" when writing tests, which could cause a lot of
problems. Instead, I think generative AI may be more helpful in end-to-end testing, 
acting in a way similar to a real user. It could help spot problems in perhaps the UI, 
or the design of the program, and help give the developers a feel of how real users might
use their platform. By using generative AI, rather than actual users or pre written 
scripts in Selenium for end-to-end testing, developers could potentially save a lot of 
money, and  reduce time spent on testing.

As an example: I gave chatGPT my unit-tests code (AllTests.php) and asked it to write an 
end-to-end test simulating how a user may call various API's, and s stress test for my 
application. The results are given below:

End-to-End testing:
    public function testCompleteUserScenario(): void
    {
        // Register a new user
        $registrationResponse = $this->registerUser('test_user', '1234567890', '1234567890');
        $this->assertTrue($registrationResponse['success']);

        // Login with the registered user
        $loginResponse = $this->loginUser('test_user', '1234567890');
        $this->assertTrue($loginResponse['success']);

        // Add a new song
        $addSongResponse = $this->addNewSong('test_artist', 'test_song', '4');
        $this->assertTrue($addSongResponse['success']);

        // Get the list of songs
        $songListResponse = $this->getSongList();
        $this->assertEquals(200, $songListResponse['statusCode']);
        $this->assertIsArray($songListResponse['data']);

        // Update a song
        // Note: Ensure 'id' corresponds to an existing song ID
        $updateSongResponse = $this->updateSong(55, 'update_artist', 'update_song', '3');
        $this->assertTrue($updateSongResponse['success']);

        // Delete a song
        // Note: Ensure 'id' corresponds to an existing song ID
        $deleteSongResponse = $this->deleteSong(56);
        $this->assertTrue($deleteSongResponse['success']);
    }

Stress-Testing:
 public function testStressServerWithMultipleRequests(): void
    {
        $concurrentRequests = 50; // Number of concurrent requests to simulate
        $totalRequests = 200; // Total number of requests to send

        $responses = [];
        $exceptionCount = 0;

        // Initiate multiple asynchronous requests
        $promises = [];
        for ($i = 0; $i < $concurrentRequests; $i++) {
            $promises[] = $this->client->getAsync('index.php'); // Change the endpoint accordingly
        }

        // Execute the requests asynchronously
        try {
            $responses = GuzzleHttp\Promise\settle($promises)->wait();
        } catch (GuzzleHttp\Exception\RequestException $e) {
            $exceptionCount++;
        }

        // Evaluate the responses and exceptions
        $successfulResponses = 0;
        foreach ($responses as $response) {
            if ($response['state'] === 'fulfilled' && $response['value']->getStatusCode() === 200) {
                $successfulResponses++;
            }
        }

        // Check if the number of successful responses meets expectations
        $this->assertGreaterThanOrEqual(
            $totalRequests - $exceptionCount,
            $successfulResponses,
            "Failed to receive expected successful responses."
        );
    }

Although these responses are pretty good, there is still a lot of room for improvement.
If you look through the stress test, I still have to manually change the endpoint, 
and it isn't testing multiple endpoints at the same time. Also with the end-to-end
testing, it is very rigid taking values from my previous test, and not adapting. This
could probably be improved by the use of specialized AI technologies designed for testing.

I also trieds using an extenstion in VScode called "Software Testing AI" through which
highlighting a function should prodcue tests for it but unfortunaltely it did not 
support php at the moment.
