I personally did not use any AI tools to assist me with testing, except for general
debugging of the code, but I can see where it can be used. I don't think that 
generative AI tools would be too helpful for unit testing because there is a chance that
it incorrectly guesses the "actual value" when writing tests, which could cause a lot of
problems. Instead, I think generative AI may be more helpful in end-to-end testing, 
acting in a way similar to a real user. It could help spot problems in perhaps the UI, 
or the design of the program, and help give the developers a feel of how real users might
use their platform. By using generative AI, rather than actual users or pre written 
scripts in Selenium for end-to-end testing, developers could potentially save a lot of 
money, and  reduce time spent on testing.
