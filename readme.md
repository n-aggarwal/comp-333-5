## Pytest

This section of the readme provides instructions on how to run the "pytest" tests.

### Setting up the environment

I will assume that you already have python installed on your machine. If not, you can downlaod it using homebrew or through the [python website](https://www.python.org/).

Next, you need to install pytest on your machine. To install pytest run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install pytest
```

or if you have on older version of python:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Running the tests

Now to run the tests, in your terminal change to the directory `problem_2`. Now just run the following command:

```bash
$ v stands for verbose
pytest -v
```

You should see the desired output.
